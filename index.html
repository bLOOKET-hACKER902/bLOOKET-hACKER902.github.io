        <p> Hi, I'm Hugo and the creator of Daily Paws, if you love you're dog I am sure you'll sign up to our program and find out all about your little doggy's life and needs. The sign up fee is $3 a month which is a cheap price for an endless supply of your dog's happiness. We also sell, buy and offer jobs to you, the customer! Enjoy your time on this amazing website. Thank you from Hugo, the creator. Hear from one of our customers who started dog walking on Daily Paws! Hi, I'm Maria and I'm 67 and really love dogs, I have 4 dogs at home who I take on walks as well as yours. It is so fun and since I am retired I love this little side hustle.
Hi, I'm James and I am 26 and have two little dogs at home called Dexter and Rudolf; they're both Golden Retreivers and love food, sleeping and muddy walks, sometimes I can't take care of them on my own so I hire some expert dog walkers who I pay to take Dexter and Rudolf on muddy walks, and I pay them a decent amount for my dog's everlasting happiness.</p>
<p> You and your furry friend will be as happy as these customers. Enjoy the website. From Hugo   </p>
